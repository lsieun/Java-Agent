# com.sun.tools.attach

Package `com.sun.tools.attach` provides the API to attach to a JavaTM virtual machine.

A tool, written in the Java Language, uses this API to attach to a target virtual machine (VM) and load its tool agent into the target VM. For example, a management console might have a management agent which it uses to obtain management information from instrumented objects in a Java virtual machine. If the management console is required to manage an application that is running in a virtual machine that does not include the management agent, then this API can be used to attach to the target VM and load the agent.
